## Normal Roblox Bootstrapper How to Use:
###### You can also do Roblox Studio
1. **Navigate to your Roblox Installation directory. Typically found at `%localappdata%\Roblox\Versions\` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Roblox\Versions`.**
2. **Identify the folder `version-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` ~~containing `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`~~ You can do this for Roblox Studio too.**
3. **Create a new folder named `ClientSettings`. Inside this folder, place the file `ClientAppSettings.json`.**
4. **Paste the JSON into `ClientAppSettings.json`. (You can utilize ChatGPT to format multiple JSONs for clarity if needed)**
5. **Save and you're good to go!**
###### Do note that after roblox updates you have to do this process again
