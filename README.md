> **Fast Flags are extremely powerful, being that they are intended to only be used by Roblox engineers. While they can be very useful, they can cause issues with stability and functionality if you don't know what you're doing.**

## Bloxstrap How to Use:
1. **Open the [Bloxstrap Menu](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap).**
2. **Navigate to `Fast Flags` >> `Fast Flags Editor` >> `Add New` >>  `Import Json`.**
3. **Paste in the JSON.**
4. **Save and your good to go!**

## Normal Roblox Bootstrapper How to Use:
###### You can also do Roblox Studio
1. **Navigate to your Roblox Installation directory. Typically found at `%localappdata%\Roblox\Versions\` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Roblox\Versions`.**
2. **Identify the folder `version-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` ~~containing `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`~~ You can do this for Roblox Studio too.**
3. **Create a new folder named `ClientSettings`. Inside this folder, place the file `ClientAppSettings.json`.**
4. **Paste the JSON into `ClientAppSettings.json`. (You can utilize ChatGPT to format multiple JSONs for clarity if needed)**
5. **Save and you're good to go!**
###### Do note that after roblox updates you have to do this process again

```
{
    "FFlagDebugSimDefaultPrimalSolver": "True",
    "DFIntMaximumFreefallMoveTimeInTenths": "1000",
    "DFIntDebugSimPrimalStiffness": "5"
}
```

 "DFIntDebugSimPrimalStiffness": "1" -- this is the main thing, the default of it is 0, however, at 0, some stuff FALLS into the floor, try yourself on games with objects, you've probably seen this yourself
so, just modify it to 1 or even 10 and over, but the higher the number the more slower you go through the wall, a good balance is probably 1-5 or 5-7 

also incase you don't understand how this even works, DFIntDebugSimPrimalStiffness setting controls how stiff objects are in the simulation. a value of 0 means objects are very flexible and easy to bend or deform.
